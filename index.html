                <p > He believed the secret of his longevity is because he "ate two eggs every morning.” “In an egg, there is everything a being needs to develop – vitamins, minerals, and hormones,” he claimed. (8) Dr. Hofmann shared in a conference speech that “mystical experiences in childhood, in which nature was altered in magical ways, and provided questions concerning the essence of the external material world” not only explained the reason of his love for chemistry and science, but perhaps also shed lights on the reason why he intentionally ingested LSD for his research. Is the exposure to chemistry (not just LSD) a way of increasing or maintaining the adaptability? We would like to think so!

        <p>A.k.a., Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the First Lady of the Republic of China and the first female Chinese political figure. She lived to 105 years old, passed away in New York, NY. She was born in China, spent her early youth (from 10 to 19 years-old) in the United State, went back to China and then lived in Taiwan until 1975, Madame Chiang lived in United States again until she passed away in New York. She not only experienced the World War II, the war against Japen, and the Civil War in China, but also played an important role in all these wars and governing over Taiwan with her husband. She studies Chinese drawing and painting after settled down in New York, and conducted an art exhibition in her late 90s. From a politician to a social service advocate to an artist, Madame Chiang certainly reached her full potential.

            <p>A celebrity, left us five good advises on how to live long and stay healthy. 1. Get out of your chair (stay physically active), 2. Enjoy a challenge at work and beyond, 3. Stay connected (to people), 4. Consider marriage (he meant stable and fulfilling marriage, which is another way to keep a social life), and 5. Be friends with healthy people. Mike Douglas also survived a (helicopter) crash in 1991, and then suffered a stroke in 1996. And then he focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life.</p>
